<h1> Python Projects </h1><br/>
<p>Welcome to my Python projects repository! Here, I am sharing the small projects I am working on to better understand the Python programming language. Each project aims to help me get hands-on experience with different aspects of Python, from basic syntax to more complex concepts.</p>
1. Dice Rolling Simulator <br/>
A simple Python program that simulates the rolling of a dice. It generates a random number between 1 and 6 and allows the user to roll again. <br/>
2. Random Name Guessing Game <br/>
A Python game where the computer picks a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low until the correct number is guessed.<br/>
