<h3>2. Random Name Guessing Game</h3>
<p>A Python game where the computer picks a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low until the correct number is guessed.</p>

<h3>3. Rock, Paper, Scissors Game</h3>
<p>A simple Python game where you play against the computer. Choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the game will determine the winner based on the classic rules. It includes input validation, score tracking, and random computer selection.</p>

<h3>4. Email Validator</h3>
<p>A Python script to validate email addresses based on common rules like proper format, valid domain, and basic structure.</p>

<h3>5. Email Validator Using Regex Module</h3>
<p>A simple Python script to validate email addresses using regular expressions. Ensures the email format follows standard conventions and helps identify valid email inputs.</p>
